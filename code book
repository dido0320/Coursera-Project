Getting and Cleaning Data 

Modifications

the original data was modified by
•	Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
•	Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
•	Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
•	Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
•	Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Descriptions
Identifiers

The first two columns - subject and activity_type - are Identifiers.
•	subject: the ID of the Subject
•	activity_type: name of the Activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken

Measurements
As mentioned above, the variables remaining are just the calculated means and standard deviations of these sets of data:
